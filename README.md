# COMP4004 Library Management System Assignment #3 - Cypress UI Testing  
**By Ryan Johnson**  

## What's New
1. Converted Java business logic into a Node.js / Express REST API
2. Added a basic HTML/JavaScript web UI to interact with the system
3. Tests now simulate real user actions (clicks, form input, visible messages)
4. Business rules stay the same; testing moves from logic-level to UI-level
5. Project runs as a single-user web application with simple session handling

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: npm install inside the frontend folder
## Running the Application
1. Start the server: npm start inside the frontend folder
2. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
## Running Cypress Tests
### Headless Mode

## Which AI(s) were used, if they were used 
I used ChatGPT to assist with converting my business logic to Node.js/Express. I also used it to build my web front end.
